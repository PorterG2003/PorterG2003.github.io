    <p id="intro">Hi, my name is Porter Gardiner. I am a junior at Utah Tech University studying Computer Science, that is interested in machine learning and artifitial intelligence. I would like to use my knowledge of these fields to help you analyse your data. I can clean datasets to be more friendly with machine learning models. I can also find which attributes play the biggest part in predicting other attributes. As of right now, I am looking for an internship to help you with your data, and to help me with my goals in machine learning.</p>
